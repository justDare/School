# MatrixMultiply.java

* Uses multithreaded programming to perform matrix multiplication

* each thread computes a cell of the resulsting matrix via the Worker.java file

* int variables m1_cols, m2_rows, m2_cols, and m2_rows hold values for operand matrices, these will also be used for dimensions of resulting matrix via matrix multiplication properties

## Running the tests

* upon running, operand matrices are generated with random ints and displayed, followed by the resulting product matrix (see screenshots)

* matrice sizes declared as variables in the MatrixMultiply.java file can be changed, as long as matrix multiplication properties are met, the code will handle various sized matrices

* initial size is set to 3x3
*Used for the purpose of COMP 3411 at [Thompson River University](https://www.tru.ca/)*
